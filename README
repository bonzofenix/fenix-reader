Stepts to deploy with capistrano:

After capistrano is setup in the application this are the following steps to put up the application:

cap deploy:setup

to create a special directory structure thatâ€™s required for Capistrano

cap deploy:check

to check local environment and servers.

cap production deploy:migrate 

to deploy the app and make migrations if needed

cap shell
 
And then run 'whenever' on apps/current so it generates the crontab file in each server where the app was deploy.
